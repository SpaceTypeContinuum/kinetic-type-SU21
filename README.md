## Course Description

Every day on our screens, we interact with type in a digital format. Although it may initially seem as static and inaccessible as print, with the aid of programming we can transform, animate, and interact with letterforms on the web. This creates new opportunities for our letters to be shaped by anyone on the web, only limited by creative imagination. Letters can interact with the viewers, be affected by sound effects, or even evolve by itself depending on the time of day! 

P5.js will be the main programming library for the course, a beginner-friendly Javascript framework. Students who are new to programming are welcome. Techniques covered in this course will include building visual compositions with code, manipulating pixel and vector data, and implementing them in real-time applications on the browser.

During the course of four evenings, there will be weekly lectures and demonstrations on different algorithmic concepts. Students will be expected to complete weekly assignments to solidify their understanding and create typographic projects of a computational nature.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Week 2 Homework

### Assignment
Create a piece that has moving typography!

* (beginner) Take demo sketches and modify them (for example: Can you swap out the 'circles' from class demo and replace them with different shapes/colors? )
* (intermediate+) Utilize classes to create an animated kinetic type sketch (if you're out of ideas, try to recreate an existing piece by someone as a learning experience!)
